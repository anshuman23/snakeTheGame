# Snake
###### by Anshuman Chhabra (copyright. 2016)

- The classic Snake game written in Python.
- Be warned, this script is very crude and has not been beautified. This game was written by me to aid another project and thus, only does the bare minimum.

### Instructions:
- load the script in terminal by typing ```python snake.py```. Do this after changing the directory to the repository.
- The game will load and the snake will start moving. You will see two coloured berries - yellow and purple. The yellow ones increase your length and score while the purple ones will lead to ```GAME OVER```.
- If the snake touches the edges of the game window or its own segments it will lead to ```GAME OVER```.
- Press ```Q``` to quit the game at any point of time. Note, there is also no restart button to reload the game since I did not require this functionality. However, this may be added in the future. Once game over, you will have to reload the script in terminal to play again. Cheers!
